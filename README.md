# Dynamics of Form

This Java program was developed as a tool to explore the dynamics of form according to the laws of form. [Laws of Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Form), published by George Spencer Brown in 1969, attempts to find the foundations of the formal sciences in the elementary form of a new arithmetic.  The program uses familiar LoF notation to generate a graphical representation of the inputted expression.  It further includes basic information about the generated structure, including a numerical approximation of the continued fraction generated by the graph.

## Background

 When a circle is drawn on a page it makes a distinction between the outside and inside.  This bi-value distinction of ‘marked’ and ‘unmarked’ is the basis of Brown’s bivalve unitary notation of the mark, from which a calculus arises where the mark acts as both operator and operand. In Laws of Form Chapter 11, higher degrees of the calculus introduce infinite terms that oscillation the two values due to the mark entering and re-entering its own negative space. Thus, higher degree expressions generate infinite series. To express these infinite terms the ‘mark’ notation is modified to become a ‘marker’. In the input notation for this program these two terms are expressed as `( )` and  `[ ]`.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run the program is to simply [download the release build](https://github.com/vibat/dynamics-of-form/releases).  Run the .exe and you're good to go!

Otherwise you can build the jar using the source. 

#### Prerequisites

The build requires [TreeLayout (download)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/treelayout/files/1.0.3/org.abego.treelayout.core-1.0.3.jar/download) to generate the structures created in the form.  

[MIGLayout (download)](http://www.migcalendar.com/miglayout/versions/4.0/miglayout-4.0-swing.jar) is also referenced to make the GUI. 

Both jars must be included if you want to build the app from source.


#### Syntax 

Name | Code | Detail 
--- | --- | ---
 Mark | `()` | A simple, single mark 
 Marker | `[]` | A re-entering mark 
 Deep re-entry marker | `1(1)1` | [Kauffman's Fibonacci](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/FQ.pdf) 
 Multiple deep re-entries | `(1(1)12(2)2)` | Two separate Kauffman Fibonaccis, enclosed under a single mark 
 Parent/child | `(())` | Parent encloses the child 
 Multi-child | `(()())` | Children both enclosed by a single parent 

 See the Help panel for more examples

#### Sample

To generate triangular numbers, input:

```
[[]]
```

And press enter.  The generated tree should be displayed.
