# Dynamics of Form

This Java program was developed as a tool to explore the dynamics of form according to the laws of form. *[Laws of Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Form)*, published by George Spencer Brown in 1969, attempts to find the foundations of the formal sciences in the elementary form of a new arithmetic.  The program uses familiar LoF notation to generate a graphical representation of the inputted expression.  It further includes basic information about the generated structure, including a numerical approximation of the continued fraction generated by the graph.

## Background

 When a circle is drawn on a page it makes a distinction between the outside and inside.  This bi-value distinction of ‘marked’ and ‘unmarked’ is the basis of Brown’s bivalve unitary notation of the mark, from which a calculus arises where the mark acts as both operator and operand. In *Laws of Form* Chapter 11, higher degrees of the calculus introduce infinite terms that oscillation the two values due to the mark entering and re-entering its own negative space. Thus, higher degree expressions generate infinite series. To express these infinite terms the ‘mark’ notation is modified to become a ‘marker’. In the input notation for this program these two terms are expressed as `( )` and  `[ ]`.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run the program is to simply [download the release build](https://github.com/vibat/dynamics-of-form/releases).  Run the .exe and you're good to go!

Otherwise you can build the jar using the source. 

#### Prerequisites

The build requires [TreeLayout (download)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/treelayout/files/1.0.3/org.abego.treelayout.core-1.0.3.jar/download) to generate the structures created in the form.  

[MIGLayout (download)](http://www.migcalendar.com/miglayout/versions/4.0/miglayout-4.0-swing.jar) is also referenced to make the GUI. 

[JFreeChart (download)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/1.%20JFreeChart/1.0.19/jfreechart-1.0.19.zip/download) is used to graph the tally & derivatives.  The required .jars (jfreechart-1.0.19.jar and jcommon-1.0.23.jar) can be found in the lib folder of the .zip archive.

All jars must be included if you want to build the app from source.

#### Syntax 

Name | Code | Detail 
--- | --- | ---
 Mark | `()` | A simple, single mark 
 Marker | `[]` | A re-entering mark 
 Deep re-entry marker | `1(1)1` | [Kauffman's Fibonacci](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/FQ.pdf) 
 Multiple deep re-entries | `(1(1)12(2)2)` | Two separate Kauffman Fibonaccis, enclosed under a single mark 
 Parent/child | `(())` | Parent encloses the child 
 Multi-child | `(()())` | Children both enclosed by a single parent 

 See the Help panel for more examples

#### Sample

To generate triangular numbers, input:

```
[[]]
```

And press enter.  The generated tree should be displayed.

## Glossary of Terms

#### General terms 
* **Degree of infinite expressions** is the re-entry depth, or ‘markers’ depth, of the expression. 
	+ Zero degree has no markers, e.g. `(()()(()))`. 
	+ First degree has a marker depth of one, e.g. `([][])`. 
	+ Second degree has marker depth of two, e.g. `([[]])`.

* **Gnomon:**
 The set of marks added at each depth of an infinite expression is call the ‘gnomons’ after the [Pythagorean usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurate_number#Gnomon) with figured numbers.

#### Home screen menu for generating the tree
* **Display Tree:** select this to display the generated tree graphic for your chosen expression. 
	+ Hint: turning this off is advisable for complex output, e.g., for depths >15

* **Color selection:** choose a colour for the nodes of the tree graphic.

* **Solid Color/Node weight**
	+ **Solid:** all nodes are the same color and intensity.
	+ **Node Weight:** the "heavier" nodes with more children are darker.

* **Value Neutral/Brownian Value:** Select “Brownian Value” to present alternating marked/unmarked values and display the oscillating fraction in the Analysis screen

* **Expression:** enter the expression you wish to iterate in this box using the standard input notation (see Getting Started–Syntax). 

* **Depth:** choose the depth to which you wish to iterate the expression.
	+ Hint: for depths >15 and for complex expression, “Display Tree” is best switched off.  

* **Save:** save the tree as a svg file.

* **Analysis:** opens a dialog with some basic analysis according to selected interpretations.

#### Analysis Screen

* **The top window:** This presents the expression iterated to the chosen depth as marks within marks using the bracket notion, where `()` is a simple empty mark. 

* **The Tally and Derivatives**  Derivative analysis of the generation. 
	+ **Tally:** The total count of marks at all depths down to the specified depth.
	+ **Gnomon Series:** The first derivative or the number of marks added at each depth. (for expression of degree >0)
	+ **Gnomon Interval:** The second derivative, or the difference of the gnomon series (for expressions of degree >1)
	+ **3rd Derivative:** The difference of the gnomon series (for expression of degree >2)

* **The bottom window:** This presents the gnomon series in a one dimensional notation. 

* **Continued fraction:** This interprets the expression as a continued fraction. For example `(()(()))` is 1/(1 + (1/1)). The continued fraction is given as a decimal numerical value. For infinite expressions this value will be the value of the expression cut off at the depth that has been specified.

* **Oscillating fraction:** This interprets gnomons in the unmarked space as ratios with the original mark and gnomons in the marked space as negative ratios with the original mark. These ratios are then added to give a decimal numerical value
	+ Hint: for `[[][]]`, this generates Leibniz’s formula for π/4. 

* **Graph:** The tally and its derivatives are represented on the Cartesian plane.
